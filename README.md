# action-repo

This is a dummy repository created for TechStaX to demonstrate GitHub Actions.

## Workflow

The included workflow (`hello.yml`) runs on every push to the `main` branch and prints a simple greeting.

### How it works

- Trigger: On push to `main` branch
- Job: Logs “Hello from GitHub Actions!” in the workflow console
